You will want to download your own "dotenv" npm package, and you will need your own spotify API key and secret (to get that you will obtain it directly from spotify); you will also need to download it from npm.

You will have 3 commands that are available for you to run;
  concert-this: this will give you an artist name and where they are playing and what dates
  
  spotify-this-song: this will give you an artist name, a song title and the album the song is listed on
  
  movie-this: this will give you a movie with additional info (title, year released, rating, country, languages, plot and actors)
